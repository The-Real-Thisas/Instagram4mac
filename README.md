# Instagram4mac
A decent instagram client for mac. 

## How does it work ?
Pretty simple stuff, it uses electron to show the web app of instagram, which is pretty good.

## Is it any good ?
It in my experiance is much better than any free app you can get from the app store, infact I made this mostly for my use.

## Installation 
Select the .app file, download it, and put it in you applications folder in mac. Thats it.

## Developer
If you want to compile it your self, go head, the code is right there. It works with the latest version of npm. Make sure you have a global installation. Just go to the folder and 
```bash
npm start
```
or it'll crash and burn and die. Good luck.
